RUWA is a very simple web analytics in Ruby on Rails 2.2. 
It's not complete and there may be bugs. The code is inspired by Piwik.org

To install, first create the db
rake db:schema:load

then launch the ./script/server and visit 
localhost:/users/add_user

The first user will be the administrator, create a second
user and login as "user". You'll create a project.

This will take a while, since every time a new User is created, 
500 random generated visitors are created for testing purpose.
It's possible to see some graphs by clicking in Graphs.

Every user has a project associated with him. The project_id 
will be used by the javascript tracker code.


To install a tracker in a website, you have to add this code
(taken from Piwik.org, a excellent open source web analytics in PHP)

<script type="text/javascript">
var pkBaseURL = 
	(("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? "https://thedomain-with-ruwa:4000/javascripts/" : "http://thedomain-with-ruwa:4000/javascripts/");
document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='" + pkBaseURL + "piwik.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"));
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
	piwik_action_name = document.location.href;
	piwik_idsite = 1;
	piwik_url = pkBaseURL + "log.js";
        action_kind = 0; // 0 normal action, 1 goals
	piwik_log(piwik_action_name, piwik_idsite, piwik_url, action_kind);
</script>


The piwik_idsite variable holds the project_id associated with the User.
